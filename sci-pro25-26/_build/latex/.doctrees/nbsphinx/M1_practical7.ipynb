A colon **:** is used to end the line holding the definition of the function. The code implementing the function is specified by using indentation. A function **might** or **might not** return a value. In the first case a **return** statement is used.\n",

    "A more flexible and powerful way of getting input from command line makes use of the ```Argparse``` [module](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/argparse.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Argparse\n",
    "\n",
    "Argparse is a command line parsing module which deals with user specified parameters (positional arguments) and optional arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Very briefly, the basic syntax of the ```Argparse module``` (for more information check the [official documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/argparse.html)) is the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Import the module:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "import argparse\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Define a argparse object:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description=\"This is the description of the program\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "note the parameter *description* that is a string to describe the program;\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Add positional arguments:\n",
    "```\n",
    "parser.add_argument(\"arg_name\", type = obj, \n",
    "                    help = \"Description of the parameter)\n",
    "```\n",
    "where ```arg_name``` is the name of the argument (which will be used to retrieve its value). The argument has type ```obj``` (the type will be automatically checked for us) and a description specified in the ```help```string.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Add optional arguments:\n",
    "```\n",
    "parser.add_argument(\"-p\", \"--optional_arg\", type = obj, default = def_val, \n",
    "                        help = \"Description of the parameter)\n",
    "```\n",
    "where ```-p``` is a short form of the parameter (and it is optional), ```--optional_arg``` is the extended name and it requires a value after it is specified, ```type``` is the data type of the parameter passed (e.g. str, int, float, ..), ```default``` is optional and gives a default value to the parameter. If not specified and no argument is passed, the argument will get the value \"None\". ```Help``` is again the description string.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Parse the arguments:\n",
    "```\n",
    "args = parser.parse_args()\n",
    "```\n",
    "the parser checks the arguments and stores their values in the ```argparse``` object that we called ```args```.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Retrieve and process arguments:\n",
    "```\n",
    "myArgName = args.arg_name\n",
    "myOptArg = args.optional_arg\n",
    "```\n",
    "now variables contain the values specified by the user and we can use them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see the example above again.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Machine Learning\n",
    "You'll explore this in more depth in other courses, but here's a super simple explanation. You are given a set of data (like images), and each piece of data has a label or category (like \"dog\" or \"cat\"). Your goal is to build a model that learns from this data so that, when it sees new, unlabeled data, it can predict the correct label (i.e., whether an image shows a dog or a cat). This process involves training the model on examples to help it make accurate predictions in the future.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In general, your data is split into a training set and a test set (ignoring validation for now). The main idea is to train your model on the training set, where the labels are available, and then evaluate its performance on the test set to see how well it can predict unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "![ML](img/ml.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the image above, you have 9 images to train your model and 2 images to test how well your model performs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab you have to implement a simple ML model: k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### What is k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)?\n",
    "k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) is one of the simplest machine learning algorithms used for classification and regression. Here, we'll focus on using it for classification, which means dividing data into categories (e.g., classifying flowers as different species).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Main Idea Behind k-NN\n",
    "The basic idea behind k-NN is **“things that are similar are likely to belong to the same group (or class).”** To classify a new data point, we look at the data points closest to it (its \"neighbors\"). We then decide what class the new data point belongs to based on the majority class among its neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### For instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given the roundness and diameter of both grapes and pears, and your task is to predict whether a fruit is a grape or a pear based on these two features (roundness and diameter). So your input data is something like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "    data = [[0.91, 1.1],[0.88, 1.3], [...] ... [0.7,4.2]]\n",
    "    label = [1,1,...,0]\n",
    "```\n",
    "The data includes the roundness and diameter of the fruits, while the label is a list where each value indicates the type of fruit (1 for grape, 0 for pear). For example, the first fruit has a roundness of 0.91 and a diameter of 1.1, and its label is 1, meaning it is a grape.\n",
    "\n",

In our case, it would find the k nearest fruits based on roundness and diameter, and classify the new fruit as either a grape or a pear based on the majority label of its closest neighbors.\n",
